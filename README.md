# Graph Theory Algorithms

This project is my  take on classic graph theory algorithms, implemented from scratch in Python. It includes step-by-step logic and intuitive structuring of:

* Prim’s Algorithm – for constructing minimum spanning trees.
* Kruskal’s Algorithm – another MST approach using edge sorting.
* A* (A-Star) – a heuristic-based algorithm for shortest pathfinding.
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm – for computing shortest paths from a source node.
